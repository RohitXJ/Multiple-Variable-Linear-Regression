# 📊 Multiple Variable Linear Regression - Supervised Machine Learning

Welcome to my first step into Supervised Learning using **Multiple Variable Linear Regression**!  
This project is part of my Machine Learning journey where I explore different algorithms through hands-on practice.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To predict a continuous target variable (like crop yield, house price, etc.) using multiple independent features (e.g., temperature, humidity, rainfall).

This is an extension of simple linear regression where the model can handle **more than one input feature** to improve prediction accuracy.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Understanding how multivariate linear regression works.
- Implementing the model using `scikit-learn` in Python.
- Evaluating performance using **R² Score**, **Mean Absolute Error**, etc.
- Visualizing predictions vs actual data.
- Handling datasets and preprocessing where needed.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Make sure `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` are installed.
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib
```

## 🚀 What's Next?

I'm continuing my learning path through other supervised ML models like:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

Stay tuned!
